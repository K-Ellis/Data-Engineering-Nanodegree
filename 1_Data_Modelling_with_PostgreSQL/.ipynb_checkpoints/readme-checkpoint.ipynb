    "# Data Modelling and ETL with Python and PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app. \n",
    "\n",
    "To address this need, `Python` and `SQL` have been used to Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) the data into a `PostgreSQL` database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "Fact and dimension tables have been designed for a star schema database design with a particular analytic focus for the startup. This star schema database design ensures that data integrity is maintained and data redundency is reduced while allowing analysts to search for and analyse data with joins and aggregations.\n",
